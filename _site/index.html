    <h1>Earth</h1>
    <!-- <script src="index.js"></script> -->
    <p>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun in our solar system and is the only known celestial body to support life. It is a rocky planet with a diverse and dynamic environment that includes continents, oceans, and an atmosphere. Earth's diameter is approximately 12,742 kilometers (7,918 miles), and it has a mass of about 5.97 trillion trillion kilograms. The planet rotates on its axis, completing one full rotation approximately every 24 hours, leading to day and night cycles. Earth also orbits the Sun, taking roughly 365.25 days to complete one orbit, defining a year. The Earth's atmosphere, composed mainly of nitrogen and oxygen, plays a crucial role in sustaining life by regulating temperature and providing the necessary gases for respiration.</p>
