    <h1>Moon</h1>
    <!-- <script src="index.js"></script> -->
    <p>The moon is Earth's only natural satellite, a celestial body that orbits our planet at an average distance of about 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers). It plays a crucial role in stabilizing Earth's axial tilt, which in turn influences our planet's climate and seasons. The moon has been a source of fascination for humans throughout history, and its phases are observable from Earth due to the varying amounts of sunlight it reflects. The moon's gravitational pull also causes ocean tides, a phenomenon that has a significant impact on Earth's coastal areas.</p>
